# Building With Intent. Learning By Doing.

I'm **Sam**, a self-taught developer working on **automation**, **web3 tools**, and AI-assisted software projects.  
I don’t have a traditional background — I use whatever I can (including AI) to figure things out and make things work.

Right now I'm focused on leveling up my fullstack skills, improving how I write and structure code, and building things that are fast, useful, and real.
